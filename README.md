#React Weather App

This weather app was written using React, my favorite framework! I had a lot of fun with this project, which took me about two sessions of 3 hours to complete. Feel free to make suggestions and use this code for your own projects.

Make sure to check out my other weather app built with Vanilla JS.

Thanks for stopping by,
